An IoT-Based Animal Detection and Repellent System for Agricultural Crop Protection Using Deep Learning and Image Processing
	
Abstract
Agriculture is a critical sector for the economy, but crop damage caused by animals such as buffaloes, cows, goats, birds, and wild elephants poses significant challenges for farmers. Traditional methods of crop protection are often inefficient and labor-intensive. This paper proposes an IoT-based animal detection and repellent system designed to detect the presence of animals in agricultural fields and deter them without causing harm. The system utilizes a combination of hardware components, including a PC for image processing, a NodeMCU microcontroller, a buzzer for generating predator sounds, and a water level sensor to monitor field conditions. The software component employs Python and OpenCV for animal feature identification, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on YOLO-DarkNet for accurate animal detection. The system is capable of distinguishing between animals and other moving objects, ensuring high accuracy in detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in protecting crops from animal interference, with potential for further improvement through larger datasets and enhanced model training.

1. Introduction
Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, but crop damage caused by animals is a significant issue that leads to substantial financial losses for farmers. Traditional methods of crop protection, such as manual surveillance and physical barriers, are often ineffective and impractical. With the advent of IoT and deep learning technologies, there is an opportunity to develop automated systems that can detect and deter animals from entering agricultural fields. This paper presents an IoT-based animal detection and repellent system that leverages image processing and deep learning to identify and scare away animals without causing them harm. The system is designed to be cost-effective, easy to implement, and scalable for use in various agricultural settings.
2. Related Work
This section provides a review of existing literature on animal detection and crop protection systems. Several studies have explored the use of IoT and machine learning for agricultural applications, including crop prediction, irrigation management, and animal intrusion prevention. For instance, Ruff et al. (2021) proposed a workflow for automated identification of animal sounds using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Similarly, Nikhil et al. (2020) developed a real-time monitoring system for agricultural land that uses IoT and machine learning for crop prediction and animal intrusion prevention. Other studies have focused on animal behavior prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Roberts & Segev, 2020) and IoT-based animal classification systems using CNNs (Vithakshana & Samankula, 2020). These studies highlight the potential of IoT and deep learning in addressing agricultural challenges, but there is still a need for more robust and accurate systems for animal detection and repellent.
3. Methodology
The proposed system consists of both hardware and software components. The hardware includes a PC for image processing, a NodeMCU microcontroller, a buzzer for generating predator sounds, and a water level sensor to monitor field conditions. The software component utilizes Python and OpenCV for image processing and animal feature identification. The system employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on YOLO-DarkNet for animal detection. The CNN model is trained using a transfer learning approach, with YOLO-DarkNet as the pre-trained model. The system is designed to detect animals such as elephants, wild boars, and buffaloes, and can distinguish between animals and other moving objects.
3.1 Hardware Components
PC: Used for image processing and running the CNN model.
NodeMCU: Connected to the PC and used to trigger the buzzer when an animal is detected.
Buzzer: Generates predator sounds to scare away animals.

3.3 System Workflow
The thermal sensor installed on the Arduino detects the presence of an animal and sends a trigger to capture an image.The captured image is processed using the CNN model to identify the animal.If an animal is detected, the system activates the buzzer to generate predator sounds and scare the animal away.The system also monitors the water level in the field and alerts the farmer if the water level exceeds a certain threshold.
